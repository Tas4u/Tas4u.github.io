    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren't relevant.  

This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.</td>
